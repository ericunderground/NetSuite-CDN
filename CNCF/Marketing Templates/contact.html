        <h2>FAQS</h2>
        <h3>Does Canadian National Christian Foundation accept grant requests?</h3>
        <p>No, CNCF is a donor advised fund and, as such, does not accept grant applications or project funding requests. Please do not use the form below to ask for a grant. In most cases, charities are introduced to CNCF by givers who want to donate to a specific international organization. Grants are initiated from the fund balances of approved recipient charities within CNCF. Charities with existing international donors who are looking for a way to effectively give to their work can request information using the form below.</p><br>
        <h3>Are there any minimum contributions or grants?</h3>
        <p>This depends on the member of the CNCF Network that is taking in the contribution.</p>
        <p>In the US and Switzerland, the Candian National Christian foundations can accept contributions of any amount. For other countries within the CNCF Network, there may be either minimum contribution recommendations or program specific requirements on incoming contributions. You can contact our Giver Services Team for more information on your specific contribution using the form below.</p>
        <p>A grant made from a CNCF Charity Fund is subject to a minimum assessment when the charity requests the onward grant distribution from their Fund. We are geared toward larger grants, so charities are encouraged to use their Fund to accumulate contributions and to request distributions when the balance is larger. Most grant disbursement requests are CHF 5,000 (or other currency equivalent) and over.</p>
